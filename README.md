README - Micro-Mouse Project

Project Overview:

Welcome to the Micro-Mouse project repository! This project focuses on the development of a fully functional micro-mouse system capable of autonomously navigating through mazes. The project encompasses various hardware and software components, including the sensor subsystem, power subsystem, motherboard, and processor. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for downloading the schematics using KiCad, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

Project Components:

Sensor Subsystem:
Responsible for detecting obstacles in the micro-mouse's path using sensors and sophisticated algorithms.

Power Subsystem:
Provides energy to power the micro-mouse's motors and auxiliary components, with a focus on efficient power management.

Motherboard:
Acts as the central hub for connecting and coordinating all hardware components within the micro-mouse system.

Processor:
Utilizes a high-performance chip for real-time data processing, navigation algorithm execution, and motor control.

I will be focusing on the sensor subsystem. The Kicad schematics have been included in this project

Open Schematics in KiCad:
Launch KiCad on your computer and open the project file (.pro) located in the schematics directory.
You can then explore and modify the schematics using KiCad's intuitive interface.

Export Schematics:
If you wish to export the schematics in a different format, such as PDF or PNG, you can do so using KiCad's export feature.
